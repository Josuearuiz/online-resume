    The inaugural Regional HSI (Hispanic-Serving Institutions) Conference for
    Southern California is a pioneering initiative designed to bring together
    a diverse group of participants, including practitioners, aspiring project
    directors, and established leaders within the educational community. The
    primary goal of this conference is to facilitate a comprehensive exchange
    of proven strategies and innovative approaches for enhancing the
    educational experiences and outcomes of Latinx students in the Southern
    California region.

    I designed this website using Figma, Photoshop, Canva and implemented in
    our cascade content management system. This was a fun one, I really liked
    the final product with the minimalist shapes and hues of blue.

  alt="academic innovation summer conference with faculty participating in discussion.">
<p>The Academic Innovation Summer Conference is a dynamic and forward-thinking event focused on "Exploring the Future of
  Work." It brings together faculty and staff from both Cal Poly Pomona and external universities to delve into critical
  topics surrounding the intersection of education and the evolving workforce. Participants can expect insightful
  keynote presentations, engaging panel discussions, and interactive workshops led by renowned experts in the fields of
  education and workforce development, providing a platform to share innovative strategies and foster collaborative
  networks for a more resilient and adaptive future.</p>
<p>I designed this one also using Figma, Photoshop, and Canva. The animations are from an Icon pack I aquired at
  Lordicon, check them out they're awesome! Had people asking me how I made those icons, when I told them how easy it
  was to use, all I got was bewilderment.</p>

<h2>ACE Women's Network - Southern California</h2>
<img src="images/ace.png" style="max-width: 400px; height: auto; border-radius: 15px;"
  alt="collage of different events from the ACE Women’s Network.">
<p>The ACE Women's Network--Southern California is part of a national group of networks that carry on the work of the
  ACE Inclusive Excellence Group and the ACE Women’s Network Executive Council.

  For more than 25 years, the ACE Women's Network has provided information and counsel to constituencies within the
  higher education community regarding policies, issues, education, and research that influence women's equity,
  diversity and advancement.</p>
<p>I designed this one with Cal Poly Pomona branding in mind. In hindsight, I should have been more creative with the
  color palettes and elements I chose. The network was happy with the final product, guess I'm my own worse critic...
